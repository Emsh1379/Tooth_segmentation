# Project Title: Tooth_segmentation using Generative U-Net Model
## Problem Statement
Dental segmentation presents a significant challenge for many dentists, especially when it comes to analyzing adult teeth in panoramic images. A common issue is identifying the extent and roots of teeth, which is crucial in various dental procedures like implants and extractions. Dentists often find these cases complex.

This research suggests employing generative neural models to delve deeper into the teeth fragmentation process.
## Dataset
World’s first dataset of children’s dental panoramic radiographs for caries segmentation and dental disease detection by segmenting and detecting annotations is published in this dataset.

There are three folders: i) adult tooth segmentation (semantic segmentation), ii) children's dental caries segmentation (instance segmentation), and iii) pediatric dental disease detection (object detection).
